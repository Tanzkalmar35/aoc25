# Advent of Code 2025 (OCaml)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. I'm using Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn and practice OCaml.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the OCaml source code for each day's solution.
- `bin/`: Executables (if any).
- `inputs/`: Input files for the puzzles.
- `test/`: Unit tests for the solutions.

## How to Run

(Instructions to compile and run solutions will be added here as the project progresses.)
